# MachineLearning
Various small projects on machine learning algorithms

## DoombyDeepQ
Realize AI-player in Doom's basic scene(only three actions:left, right, shot) with deep Q-learning

## FaceRating
This programm shows how to find frontal faces in an image and judge their attractiveness. The face detector I use is **hape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat**.


if you are in the FaceRating folder then you can execute this program by running:
        `./face_landmark_detection.py ../test_img/test.jpg`
